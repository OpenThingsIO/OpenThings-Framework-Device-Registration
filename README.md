# OpenThings Framework - Device Registration

This is a Wordpress plugin used to add a new device to a user's Wordpress account under the My Account page.

## Use:

This plugin adds a new link and page called My Devices.

## Known issues:

The schema.sql depends on a "standard" wordpress install meaning the database is `wordpress` and the table prefix is `wp_`. Please update the schema before loading if your install differs.
